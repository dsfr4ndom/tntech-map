		This Georgian Architectural Style building, designed by Benjamin F. Hunt of R.H. Hunt
		and Company, was commissioned by TPI President Quintin Miller Smith in 1929 to house 
		the Engineering Department. Completed in 1931, it became the new model for all buildings
		to follow on the TPI campus, exemplifying its beauty with red brick and archways amidst
		the classic sidewalks and shade trees that characterize an ideal college campus.
