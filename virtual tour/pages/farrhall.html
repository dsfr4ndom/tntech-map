		TPI began growing at a nicely manageable rate by 1927, but more students meant
		more buildings. President Quentin M. Smith managed to get certain state appropriations
		to build more academic buildings at TPI. Thus, the Science Building was born. Designed 
		in the Georgian Revival Style by Hart, Freeland, and Roberts architectural firm, it
		housed the science and education departments for many years. In 1962, it was dedicated 
		to its current namesake, Professor TJ Farr, a founding member of TPI and a great Tennessee 
		Tech legacy.
